In Android GUI is always an important part of any application, because ordinary users don't know and don't care about what's behind the scene; they want something easy to work with and now a days attractive GUI is a must for most applications.

Although making an appealing and innovative interface needs something more than just programming skills and knowledge, every programmer should know how to customize different GUI components within whatever framework and environment they are working.When designing GUIs, most of the times you want to change the appearance of buttons, input Fields, menus etc.. 

Android Selectors have been provided to solve all these kind of problems, they enable us to decide what to show and how to show based on different states of each components.
For example. You can tell a button to have black background color with red text color when it is in pressed state or whatever else.
